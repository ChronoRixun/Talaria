# Talaria — Open Items / Follow-ups

**Compiled:** 2026-06-23 · **From:** the models-shim / Phase-B wiring session.
**Landed this session (on `main`, merge `98a9a89`):** T1 (Settings→Models dual-write
picker), T2 (regex + copy fixes), shim cache-bust. See the merge commit for detail.

## 1. 🔧 T4 — Host reconciliation (chat gateway ↔ shim)

**Recon (done):** the **mini** runs *both* Hermes services on one box, sharing
`~/.hermes/config.yaml`:
- Hermes **gateway** on `*:8642` (the chat backend the app sends `/model` to).
- Models **shim** on `:8765` (the picker's model list + set-default).

`http://localhost:8642` and `http://100.79.222.100:8642` (mini tailnet IP) both reach the
gateway; OJAMD `100.110.102.59:8642` did **not** answer. So in the **simulator dev loop
the chat gateway and the shim are the same host (the mini) → coherent, no mismatch.** This
is why the dual-write's `/model` leg succeeded with a kimi model.

**Remaining gap — on-device (TestFlight):**
- The app's Hermes API base URL is currently persisted as `http://localhost:8642`. That
  only works because the simulator runs *on the mini*; on a physical phone `localhost`
  is the phone, not the mini.
- The in-code default is the **stale** `http://ojamd:8642` (the old Windows box, which
  did not respond) — see `UserSettings.defaultHermesAPIBaseURL`.
- The shim URL default is already tailnet-correct (`http://100.79.222.100:8765`).

**Decision needed before TestFlight:** point the Hermes API base URL at the mini's tailnet
address — either `http://100.79.222.100:8642` or, preferably, a `tailscale serve` HTTPS
MagicDNS name (also removes the `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` ATS exception). Then chat +
picker are the same box from any network.

## 2. ⛔ T3 — Settings screens build (BLOCKED)

Needs the Claude Design deliverable: the 8-screen **`Settings.dc.html`** (from
`TalariaSettings.zip`) placed at **`design/Settings.dc.html`** in the repo. Then build the
6 non-MODELS screens (01 SYSTEM, 02 UPLINK, 05 VOICE, 06 APPEARANCE-HUD, 07 SESSIONS,
08 DIAGNOSTICS). MODELS (03/04) is already done (T1). **Blocker: hand off the design file.**

## 3. 📝 xcodegen needed when adding/removing source files

This project's generated `.xcodeproj` lists every source file **explicitly** (no Xcode
synchronized-folder groups). Editing existing `.swift` files needs nothing, but **adding
or removing** files requires `xcodegen generate` + committing the regenerated
`project.pbxproj` — otherwise new files don't compile in. (This is why it hadn't been
needed since project setup: no files had been added since.)
**Optional improvement:** enable synchronized folder groups so new files auto-include.

## 4. 💤 Expensive-model confirm guard (wired, dormant)

The app handles the shim's `{ok:false, confirm_required:true, confirm_message}` response
(→ confirm dialog → re-POST with `confirm_expensive:true`). This comes from the shim
(`tools/models-shim/shim.py`, committed `e019415`) wrapping Hermes's own
`hermes_cli.model_cost_guard.expensive_model_warning` — not Dylan's shell, not new app
scope. It is currently **dormant**: on this box `expensive_model_warning` returns nothing
for opus / deepseek-pro, so the dialog can't be triggered live. Revisit if/when the box's
cost-guard is enabled.

## 5. 📝 Host-status display quirk

In Settings, the host orb briefly showed "OFFLINE · STANDBY" (amber) while the Connection
row's "Status" read "CONNECTED". Likely transient / two sources of truth for host health.
Worth a glance; not a blocker.

---

## 6. 📝 config.yaml provider normalization (acknowledged)

The shim's set-default writes the canonical slug, so `config.yaml`'s `provider` changed
`kimi-for-coding` → `kimi-coding` (same provider). Cosmetic; left as-is per Owen.

---

## 7. 📝 DEBUG shim-token launch-env seam (informational)

`ModelsShimClient`'s token provider falls back to a `TALARIA_SHIM_TOKEN` launch-env var in
**DEBUG only** (for simulator verification without idb keyboard injection). Production reads
the Keychain (`talaria.modelsShimToken`) only. No token in git.

---

## 8. 📝 TestFlight (future gate)

On-device + HealthKit work is gated on a TestFlight build. Ties to item 1 (base URL) and
the `tailscale serve` HTTPS work. Add Shelley as the second tester when ready.
